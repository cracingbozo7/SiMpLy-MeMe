# Simply Meme
Simply Meme is a Simply Love SM5 spin that combines cracingbozo7's Simply Unprofessional and the internet (also, Richerrrd) in a way that any StepMania meme lover will enjoy.

# History
The theme was developed starting in the UKSRT (TaroNuke) Discord when crazingbozo7 noted the Simply Love edits were starting to become a meme. For PCBoyGames, Simply Vowels. For Zerinho6, Simply Brazil. For Vinyl Melody, Melody Vinyl. An idea sparked crazingbozo7: _what if we made a Simply Love meme based on memes?_ And so the development started. The team was formed: crazingbozo7, Zerinho6, and PCBoyGames.

# Installation
If you are using SM5, be sure to install the Simply Meme theme. If you are using SM5.2 (which is currently in development), use Simply Meme 5.2. Put the aforementioned folder into the theme folder. The cascade of folders should look like this: _SM5 Build/Themes/Simply Meme_.

# Be sure to enjoy, and remember: _go crazy._
